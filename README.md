# Authentication & Spring Security

### Task

This module is an extension of REST API Advanced module and covers following topics:

1. Spring Security framework
2. Oauth2 and OpenId Connect
3. JWT token

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. OAuth 2.0 is a security standard where you give one application permission to access your data in another application. The steps to grant permission, or consent, are often referred to as authorization or even delegated authorization. You authorize one application to access your data, or use features in another application on your behalf, without giving them your password. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a thin layer that sits on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds login and profile information about the person who is logged in. JSON Web Tokens are JSON objects used to send information between parties in a compact and secure manner.

#### Application requirements

1. Spring Security should be used as a security framework.
2. Application should support only stateless user authentication and verify integrity of JWT token.
3. Users should be stored in a database with some basic information and a password.

User Permissions:

     - Guest:
        * Read operations for main entity.
        * Signup.
        * Login.
     - User:
        * Make an order on main entity.
        * All read operations.
     - Administrator (can be added only via database call):
        * All operations, including addition and modification of entities.

4. Get acquainted with the concepts Oauth2 and OpenId Connect
5. (Optional task) Use Oauth2 as an authorization protocol.
    a. OAuth2 scopes should be used to restrict data.
    b. Implicit grant and Resource owner credentials grant should be implemented.
6. (Optional task) It's allowed to use Spring Data. Requirement for this task - all repository (and existing ones) should be migrated to Spring Data.

## Demo

1. Generate for demo at least 
    a. 1000 users
    b. 1000 tags
    c. 10???000 gift certificates (should be linked with tags and users)
All values should look like more -or-less meaningful: random words, but not random letters 
2. Demonstrate API using Postman tool (prepare for demo Postman collection with APIs)  
3. (Optional) Build & run application using command line


# Previouce REST API

# (Advanced)

### Task


#### Part 1

Migrate your existing Spring application from a previous module to a Spring Boot application.

#### Part 2

##### Business requirements

This sub-module is an extension of REST API Basics, and it covers such topics as pagination, sorting, filtering and HATEOAS. Please imagine that your application has a lot of data, so when you make a GET request it will return, for instance, 1 million records. This will take much time to process such request and return the result to the consumer of your API. That is exactly what pagination, sorting, and filtering can solve. The other topic is HATEOAS what stands for the phrase "Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State". When you are viewing a web page, you see data on it and can perform some actions with this data. In REST when you request a resource you get the details of the resource in the response. Along with it you can send the operations that you can perform on the resource. And this is what HATEOAS does.

The system should be extended to expose the following REST APIs: 
1. Change single field of gift certificate (e.g. implement the possibility to change only duration of a certificate or only price). 
2. Add new entity User.
   * implement only get operations for user entity.
3. Make an order on gift certificate for a user (user should have an ability to buy a certificate).
4. Get information about user???s orders. 
5. Get information about user???s order: cost and timestamp of a purchase.
   * The order cost should not be changed if the price of the gift certificate is changed.
6. Get the most widely used tag of a user with the highest cost of all orders.
   * Create separate endpoint for this query.
   * Demonstrate SQL execution plan for this query (explain).
7. Search for gift certificates by several tags (???and??? condition).
8. Pagination should be implemented for all GET endpoints. Please, create a flexible and non-erroneous solution. Handle all exceptional cases. 
9. Support HATEOAS on REST endpoints.

##### Application requirements

1. JDK version: 8. Use Streams, java.time.*, an etc. where it is appropriate. (the JDK version can be increased in agreement with the mentor/group coordinator/run coordinator)
2. Application packages root: com.epam.esm.
3. Java Code Convention is mandatory (exception: margin size ???120 characters).
4. Apache Maven/Gradle, latest version. Multi-module project.
5. Spring Framework, the latest version.
6. Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL, latest version.
7. Testing: JUnit, the latest version, Mockito.
8. Service layer should be covered with unit tests not less than 80%.

#### Part 3

This sub-module covers following topics:
1. ORM
2. JPA & Hibernate
3. Transactions
ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. It???s a bit of an abstract concept ??? but basically it???s a technique that allows us to query and change data from the database in an object oriented way. ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a relational database that allows a developer to write Java code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database. Developers can use the programming language they are comfortable with to work with a database instead of writing SQL statements or stored procedures. A JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification of Java which is used to access, manage, and persist data between Java object and relational database. It is considered as a standard approach for Object Relational Mapping. JPA can be seen as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems. Being a specification, JPA doesn't perform any operation by itself. Thus, it requires implementation. So, ORM tools like Hibernate, TopLink, and iBatis implements JPA specifications for data persistence. A transaction usually means a sequence of information exchange and related work (such as database updating) that is treated as a unit for the purposes of satisfying a request and for ensuring database integrity. For a transaction to be completed and database changes to made permanent, a transaction has to be completed in its entirety.

#### General requirements

1. Code should be clean and should not contain any ???developer-purpose??? constructions.  
2. App should be designed and written with respect to OOD and SOLID principles. 
3. Code should contain valuable comments where appropriate. 
4. Public APIs should be documented (Javadoc). 
5. Clear layered structure should be used with responsibilities of each application layer defined.  
6. JSON should be used as a format of client-server communication messages.  
7. Convenient error/exception handling mechanism should be implemented: all errors should be meaningful and localized on backend side. Example: handle 404 error: 

        ??? HTTP Status: 404
        ??? response body    
        ??? {
        ??? ???errorMessage???: ???Requested resource not found (id = 55)???,
        ??? ???errorCode???: 40401
        ??? }
         
    where *errorCode??? is your custom code (it can be based on http status and requested resource - certificate or tag) 
8. Abstraction should be used everywhere to avoid code duplication. 
9. Several configurations should be implemented.

# (Basics)

#### Business requirements
1. Develop web service for Gift Certificates system with the following entities (many-to-many):
![](media/model.png)\
    - *CreateDate*, *LastUpdateDate* - format *ISO 8601* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Example: 2018-08-29T06:12:15.156. More discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914404/how-to-get-current-moment-in-iso-8601-format-with-date-hour-and-minute 
    - *Duration* - in days (expiration period)
2. The system should expose REST APIs to perform the following operations:
    - CRUD operations for GiftCertificate. If new tags are passed during creation/modification ??? they should be created in the DB. For update operation - update only fields, that pass in request, others should not be updated. Batch insert is out of scope.
    - CRD operations for Tag.
    - Get certificates with tags (all params are optional and can be used in conjunction):
        - by tag name (ONE tag)
        - search by part of name/description (can be implemented, using DB function call)
        - sort by date or by name ASC/DESC (extra task: implement ability to apply both sort type at the same time).
